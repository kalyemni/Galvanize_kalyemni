## CASE-STUDY - Practice with Pandas


You will be analyzing the worldcup dataset from the 2018 tournament.

### Learning objectives

   By the end of this unit you will be able to:

   1. Manipulate the dataframes using logical expressions and indexing
   2. Summarize you data
   3. Formulate testable questions about a dataset that is new to you
   4. Answer your using aggregrate tables and simple visualizations
   5. Communicate you findings

If you have not yet learned how to make plots using a pandas dataframe see the links below to get started.

Another important part of this case study is learning how to collaborate as a team using GitHub.

### The data

Before we jump into the data it can be useful to give a little background so that you can better understand the features.

There are 32 teams, each representing a single country, that compete in groups or pools then the best teams from those groups compete in a single elimination tournament to see who will become world champions. This is by far the worldâ€™s most popular sport so one would hope that the governing organization FIFA did a good job composing the pools. If for example there are 8 highly ranked teams then each of those teams should be in a different pool.

### Process

   1. Come up with a plan about how you will effectively collaborate
   2. Explore the data for some amount of time
   3. As a group determine which question or questions you would like to address
   4. Use your collaboration strategy to summarize the data and answer the questions
   5. Summarize your findings on slides or in a 'clean' notebook that you can give a short presentation from


### Example Questions

   * Were the teams set up in a fair way?
   * Are there any of the top ranked teams that have unfair first matches?
   * How well does a teams current rank correspond to historical worldcup performance?


HINT: We will talk more formally about feature engineering later in the course, but if you already have domain knowledge
you could use feature engineering to create new columns that help you answer your questions.
